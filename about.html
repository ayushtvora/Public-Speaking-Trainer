        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-2">Product Name] is a two-minute exercise that will help you get better at public speaking and speaking on the spot. It will help you build confidence and reinforce speaking habits by identifying stuttering and filler words, and repetition. [Product Name] will also check for good posture to make sure you are looking and speaking as confidently as you can.<br>
          <br>First, you will have one minute to prepare. You will be given a topic, and you can start brainstorming ideas on what to talk about to prepare for the exercise. After the minute, you will have a chance to speak about your topic. Try to speak until the end of the limit, but don't go overboard!
